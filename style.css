  Unfortunately WordPress will require a style.css file
  located in the theme's root folder for stuff to work.

  However, we will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using Sass.

  All Sass files are located in the /assets/scss folder.
  Please note that none of your scss files will be compiled to /stylesheets/foundation.css before you run
  'npm run watch' or 'npm run build'.

  If you for some reason would like to write plain css instead of using Sass,
  you could just enqueue this file (style.css) to the header and add your styles in this file
